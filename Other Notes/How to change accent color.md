Because Notiz uses different colors for each light theme and dark theme, it was configured with the [Style Settings](obsidian://show-plugin?id=obsidian-style-settings) community plugins.

To change the accent color, or any other configurations, press **"Control + P (or Cmd + P on macOS)"** to open a command palette and run **"Style Settings: Show style settings view."**

Once you're in style settings, you can search "Accent" in the top search bar to search the options.
